# Leet_Code Exercises

*Welcome to my LeetCode repository!* ðŸ‘‹

LeetCode is a platform that offers a large collection of coding problems, ranging in difficulty from **easy to hard**.
These problems are designed to test and improve your skills in **algorithms, data structures, and problem solving**.

In this repository, you will find my solutions to a selection of LeetCode problems.
The solutions are organized by difficulty, with easy, medium, and hard problems each having their own directory.

## Easy Problems
Easy problems are designed to be **relatively straightforward**, and can often be solved using basic techniques and familiar data structures.
These problems are designed to be a good starting point for those new to LeetCode or to competitive programming in general.

## Medium Problems
Medium problems are more challenging than easy problems, and may require more advanced techniques. It involves a lot of **recursive algorithms**.
I think these problems are a good way to improve my skills and prepare for more difficult challenges.

## Hard Problems
Hard problems are the most challenging problems on LeetCode.
These problems are designed to test your problem-solving and coding abilities to the limit, and may require a combination of advanced techniques and **creative thinking** to solve.

Overall, the purpose of doing LeetCode exercises is to improve my skills in algorithms, design patterns, and problem solving. 
I hope you find my solutions useful and informative, and I look forward to seeing your own solutions and progress on LeetCode!
